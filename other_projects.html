			<h1>Other Projects</h1>
			<h4>Deliverables: <span class="font-primary">responsiveness audit, heuristic evaluation, storyboard, user persona</span></h4>
			<h4>Time to Read: <span class="font-primary">7 minutes</span></h4>
			<br />
			<p>
				These are limited-scope works (for school, etc.) that don’t fit neat into individual portfolio pieces.
			</p>
			<p>
				I haven't numbered them as the other portfolio pieces are numbered, because there is no progression that's represented in these projects. It's a chain of one-offs.
			</p>
			<p>Most of these represented learning; and so aren't necessarily professional-grade works.</p>
<h3>Heuristics Evaluation</h3>
			<p>
				Heuristics, in UX, are principles of interaction design; that is, rules of thumb for how systems (e.g. websites, apps, etc.) should behave with user interaction.
			</p>
			<p>
				UX frontiersman Jakob Nielsen, of the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/">Nielsen Norman Group</a>, wrote his list “10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design” in 1995; and these are still in current use <span class="bold">(I didn't make this; it's a modified list of the original 10 by Scott Klemmer and Janaki Kumar)</span>:
			</p>
			<img src="img/portfolio/OTHER_NIELSEN10USABILITYHEURISTICS.jpg" class="s-img" alt="Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics (modified, somewhat).">
			<p>
				I did an heuristic evaluation of two transportation websites – www.greyhound.ca and www.viarail.ca – with Nielsen’s heuristics as a guide (with the heuristic violation, and severity rating for each from 1 (the least severe) to 5 (the most severe).
			</p>

			<img src="img/portfolio/OTHER_HeuristicEvalD.png" alt="Greyhound Canada heuristic evaluation second page.">
			<h3>Site Audits</h3>
			<p>
				Knowledge of design is as much about an awareness of good design as it is about an awareness of bad design.
			</p>
			<p>
				The user doesn’t (always) have the lingo to explain what about an experience is “bad”; e.g. the user doesn’t need to reference CSS media queries or breakpoints to express frustration about a website’s mobile un-friendliness.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a UX Designer, the skill to audit a design of a website, app, etc. and suggest (or develop) improvements is important.
			</p>
			<p>
				These are two simple responsiveness audits I did for school: the first is for www.rollingstones.com; and the second is for www.davidbowie.com.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a caveat: the designs of these websites could have changed in the time since I performed these audits.
			</p>

			<h3>Storyboarding</h3>
			<p>
				Storyboarding is where a designer illustrates a use case of a product (e.g. website, app, etc.); how a user might engage with the product in certain contexts.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, a six-panel storyboard for an Uber-style app might go like:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>1st panel: user is late for a big date (the user’s problem is identified: he/she needs to get somewhere FAST</li>
				<li>2nd panel: user attempts to take the bus, but misses it (the user attempts to resolve his/her own problem with a usual method, but fails) </li>
				<li>3rd panel: user remembers new “taxi app” (the app comes into focus for the user as a potential solution to his/her problem) </li>
				<li>4th panel: user opens app on his/her mobile (app is shown in simple detail; useful parts of interface only, should show what app does, without graphics or distractions so, e.g., a “find nearest taxi” button is shown)</li>
				<li>5th panel: driver arrives, banters (“how are you?”, “that was fast!”, whatever; result of the app’s use is shown) </li>
				<li>6th panel: user arrives for date, pays driver via app (the app solved the user’s problem) </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Storyboards are meant to be simple, lo-fi; their purpose is to illustrate use cases and build ideas; not to win awards for creative merit (which, as an awful sketch artist, I’m grateful for).
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold">I made a storyboard for an idea that I had for LED panels for at bus stops / subway stations that state the capacities of upcoming busses/subways on their routes</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s a fanciful idea – I don’t pretend to understand the tech. requirements for a system like this – but it could illustrate the value of storyboards to the design process.
			</p>

			<h3>User Personas</h3>
			<p>
				The development of good, user-aware personas is an important skill for UX Designers.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Who are our users?” is a fundamental question of smart design.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example: if I were to design a mobile application for users to report automobile accidents to their insurance provider, I might develop a fake user called Ben Disraeli who:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>is a 40-year-old boat salesman</li>
				<li>considers himself a great driver</li>
				<li>has low-to-moderate tech. skills</li>
				<li>is impatient</li>
				<li>is frugal</li>
				<li>is in love with his car; and puts a lot of care in to it</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Picture Ben after a small automobile accident. He’s anxious: concerned about his car, and about the cost (insurance premiums, his time, etc.).
			</p>
			<p>
				He gets on his phone; and decides to use the app instead of a phone call.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="bold">How does the app onboard Ben?</span> He’s rattled: he doesn’t want to scroll through a bunch of tutorial slides; he wants to sign-in, or register. If it’s the latter, he doesn’t want to fill out a huge form with two “Enter a secret question…” fields; he wants to enter his name, his insurance number and a password. Task reduction is golden for Ben, here.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because Ben is anxious, content/visual design that suggests reassurance, calmness, etc., and is jargon-free, would be of benefit to his experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once Ben’s inside the interface, he wants to submit a claim and expects to see a button to do that; a loud “SUBMIT CLAIM”, which leads to an organized, <span class="bold">well-labelled form for pertinent, immediate-need information</span> above a large “SUBMIT” button with a message like “Your insurance agent has received your form and will take it from here. Thank you!” and offer Ben follow-up information on completion.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is an incomplete example, but it should illustrate the importance of user personas (and user stories) to plan designs around.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’ve included an (unrelated) user persona that I developed for Google Play Music in AxureRP:
			</p>
			<img src="img/portfolio/OTHER_UserPersona.png" alt="A user persona for Google Play Music.">
			<p>
				I hadn’t developed a full user persona before; and I could’ve dialed down the “social media” pastiche – I spent a lot of time on the fake interface, which was unimportant to the persona itself – but it illustrates what a persona looks like.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyway, that's the end of the other products page; but if you're interested, check back periodically to see new additions!
